        <p>Hello all! I'm Adrian Sedano, a recent graduate from Flatiron School, and I'm excited to kick-start my journey in software engineering and development. During my time at Flatiron, I mastered key technologies like JavaScript, React, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, HTML, and CSS. I'm eager to apply these skills in a dynamic tech environment where innovation thrives. <br/><br/>Beyond technical proficiency, my academic journey, including a Bachelor of Arts in Spanish and Linguistics, and a Master of Public Administration, has shaped me into a well-rounded individual. These experiences have not only refined my problem-solving skills but also instilled in me the importance of effective teamwork to achieve common goals. <br/><br/>I am passionate about leveraging my unique blend of technical expertise and diverse academic background to contribute meaningfully to the software engineering landscape. Let's connect and explore how I can bring a fresh perspective and collaborative spirit to your team!</p>
